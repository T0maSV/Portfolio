                Thomas is on the fence about his future specialization. He doesn't know whether he should orient himself towards cyber-security or the Internet of Things and Mobility for the next two years. What is certain is that he hopes to be well ranked after his certificate to choose what he wants to do. 
                <br><br>
                Currently, he is thinking of pursuing the second choice, and specializing in the Internet of Things. To do so, he is thinking of entering an engineering school that specializes in the Internet of Things. There are many schools to choose from, and he doesn't know which one he wants to attend yet.
                <br><br>
                Beyond being an engineer, Thomas hopes to join a company that is connected to space and the environment and that shares his values and passions.
                Thomas thinks that joining this type of company will be better to be more productive and to feel that him belong.
