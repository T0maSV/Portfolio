                Thomas is one the fence about his future specialisation, he doesn't know if he orient him in cyber-security or in Internet of Things and Mobility for the next two years. What is certain is that he hopes to be well ranked after his certificate to choose what he wants.
                <br><br>
                Currently, he plans to the second course choice, he wants to specialise him in Internet Of Things.  To reach his project, he thinks entering an engineering school in Internet Of Things. There are many schools and he does't know which one he wants.
                <br><br>
                Beyond being an engineer, Thomas hopes joining a company related with space and the environment, he wants to join a company with his own values and passion.
                Thomas thinks that joining this type of company will be better to be more productive and to feel he belong.
